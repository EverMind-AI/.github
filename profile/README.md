**Building intelligent memory systems for AI that truly understands**

## Our Mission

We're creating AI systems that don't just respond — they remember, understand, and grow with every interaction. Our goal is to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human-like contextual understanding.

## Flagship Project

### [EverMemOS](https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverMemOS)

An enterprise-grade intelligent memory system that transforms how AI remembers and reasons.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Coherent Narrative** — Automatically links conversation fragments into complete stories, enabling AI to truly understand context
- **Evidence-Based Perception** — Proactively surfaces relevant memories at critical moments for informed decision-making
- **Living Profiles** — Dynamically learns and updates user understanding with every interaction

**Performance:** Achieved **92.3%** reasoning accuracy on the LoCoMo benchmark.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10+ · FastAPI · MongoDB · Elasticsearch · Milvus · Redis
